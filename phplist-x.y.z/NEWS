NEWS, things to be aware off between versions

version 2.4.1
I have moved the language files into a different directory, which means that
you will have to take the default config file and re-adapt it to your situation.
It is now easier to select your language as all the language files are in /texts/
Even if you have an english installation it will be easy to update the texts
that appear in the public pages in the file english.inc.

version 2.6.4
Some of the references of files have changed, which means that you will need to
re-edit the config file from the distribution to make it work again. Sorry about
that. It was necessary to make the whole system more secure.
