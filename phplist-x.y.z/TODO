PHPlist, wishlist and future plans, not in order of priority
(* -> done, or at least started)

- Optimize database structure to really deal with large
  amounts of emails. It works now, but not *that* fast
- List Archive entry
  A searchable archive of the lists, to use via the web
- Allowing running processes to be viewed and killed
- allow choice for multiple send processes
- "preview" of messages to send, so you can check whether the layout is ok
- editing of messages that have been sent
* checkbox group needs updating to make it selectable for sending
- flexible translation interface
- make system multilingual and allow user to choose language
- placeholder parsing in subscribe, confirm and unsubscribe messages
- system messages need to be identifiable for bounces
- direct delivery of subscription message to make sure it can arrive, and
  give error when it can't
- move configurable stuff outside the webroot, to make upgrading easier
- send to users of a list, who are *not* on another list
- scheduled sending
- allow html in footer
* be able to run in safe_mode
* start working towards register_globals = off
- add input box to sign up multiple users in one go with import
- seperate message for signing up people from import
- statistics retrieval (#lists #users #messages)
- integration with other OSS projects
- bit of cleaning up of files
- whatever else comes up, probably loads more....

bugs, aargh the list is growing too quickly
- stripslashes type problems in emails and subscribe page
- saving user when not using attributes fails
- sending to users who existed before attributes were added fails
- import of simple list of emails seems not to work
- checkbox group updates don't send all values
- checkbox group uncheck everything at preferences is not remembered
- importing via import2 copies info field into every other one imported??
- people are still having problems with HTML emails
- javascript errors in IE??
- translations not always implemented, particularly the system and error messages
- action of forms are not identified, which goes wrong on non apache servers
